# Etch-a-Sketch   
*DOM manipulation in JavaScript*

---

### The Plan
1. [ ] Create a webpage with JS-generated 16x16 square divs.
- Make those divs in a "container" div as the parent grid
- Using... CSS grid!

2. [ ] Set up a "hover" effect so the div changes color as the mouse passes over them, leaving a pixelated trail through the grid
- "Hovering" happens when the mouse enters or leaves the div. Set up event listeners for either event
- Change div's colors by adding a class to the div
- Or change the div's color property directly with JS

3. [ ] Add a button to ask for the resolution of the new grid, which should replace the old grid (total size of the grid stays the same)
- Set a limit such as 100 square divs maximum can be generated

*If something isn't working, remember to...*
- Link the CSS stylesheet
- Use the browser's dev tools
- Check for errors in the console
- console.log() stuff
